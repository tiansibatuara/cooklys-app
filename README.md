# cooklys-app
This is a sample React Native project that demonstrates how to integrate Firebase Firestore and Redux into your mobile application.

## Features

- User authentication using Firebase Authentication.
- Firestore database integration for storing and retrieving data.
- Basic CRUD operations on Firestore collections and documents.
- Real-time data synchronization with Firestore listeners.
- React Navigation for screen navigation.
- Styling using React Native StyleSheet.
- Components for displaying data in lists and detail views.
- State management using Redux for global state.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-native-firestore-project.git

2. Install dependencies:

cd react-native-firestore-project
npm install

3. Set up Firebase project:
- Create a new project in the Firebase console.
- Enable Firebase Authentication and Firestore services.
- Generate and download the Firebase configuration file (google-services.json for Android, GoogleService-Info.plist for iOS).
- Place the configuration file in the project's root directory.

4. Set up Redux:
- The project already includes Redux dependencies and a basic Redux setup.
  You can customize and expand the Redux implementation as needed for your project.

5. Run the app:
    
    npx react-native run-android   # For Android
    npx react-native run-ios       # For iOS
    
    
CONFIGURATION
   The Firebase configuration is stored in the src/firebase/firebaseConfig.js file. Update the configuration with your own Firebase project credentials.


// src/firebase/firebaseConfig.js

export const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
};

Redux Implementation
    The project includes a basic Redux setup for managing global state. The Redux-related files are located in the src/redux directory.

src/redux/actions: Contains action creators for performing actions such as fetching data, adding items, updating items, and deleting items.
src/redux/reducers: Defines the reducers that handle different actions and update the state accordingly.
src/redux/store: Configures the Redux store and combines the reducers.
You can customize and expand the Redux implementation based on your application's requirements.
